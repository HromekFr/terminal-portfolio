# Terminal-Style Portfolio Website


## Overview

This project represents a simulation of a terminal where you can list some classic portfolio facts, like about me or projects.
This was built to test the capabilities of AI coding tools and get a better grasp of them. I was using Claude Sonnet 3.5 and GitHub Copilot.
